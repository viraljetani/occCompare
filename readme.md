### Occompare

Compare two selected occupations in terms of Skills using ONET data. 

The zipped bundle provides the bare-minimum Laravel and Vue bootstrapping for your convenience. The parser service has been implemented to return a list of core skills along with their importance value from ONET. You are expected to come up with a *matching algorithm* that shows the similarity between the two occupations selected, in percentage value. We estimate it will take around 2 hours to complete, give or take.

##### What will we assess?
- Your coding practices, standards, and architecture
- Performance optimization throughout the application
- The efficiency of the algorithm
- Front end skills and UX design
- Ingenuity

We DO NOT expect you to write unit tests.

##### How to submit?
Upload your work to a git repository and send us the link. We need to be able to download the repository.

##### What to expect after submission?
We appreciate the time you spend and we promise to get back to you with a review of your code as soon as we can. The review will outline what we liked and what we did not. You are NOT expected to make any further revisions to your code after the review.
